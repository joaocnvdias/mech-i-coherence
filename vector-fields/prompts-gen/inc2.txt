[{"role": "user", "content": "Generate a brief story. As you write, occasionally insert sentences or short paragraphs that are complete non-sequiturs, breaking the narrative logic before snapping back to the main story. Your story must feature the following three elements:
- A lonely lighthouse keeper named Silas who knits sweaters for fish.
- A talking seagull who acts as his confidant but only gives terrible, nonsensical advice.
- The sudden appearance of a mysterious ghost ship made of shimmering moonlight."}]
